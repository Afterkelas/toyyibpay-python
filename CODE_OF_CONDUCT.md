# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in this unofficial ToyyibPay Python SDK community project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Helping others learn about payment gateway integrations and Python development
* Writing clear, well-documented code and helpful issue reports
* Being patient with newcomers and helping them get started
* Understanding that this is a volunteer project maintained in someone's free time
* Contributing back to the project if you find it useful

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Sharing API keys, secret keys, or other sensitive payment gateway credentials
* Attempting to exploit or hack payment systems
* Providing code or assistance for illegal financial activities
* Making demands or having entitled attitudes toward a free, volunteer-maintained project
* Harassment of the maintainer for features, fixes, or support

## Our Responsibilities

The project maintainer (and any community moderators) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

The maintainer has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

As this is a volunteer-maintained project created to help the community, the maintainer's time is limited. The community is encouraged to self-moderate and help maintain these standards.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

* Using an official project e-mail address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
* Contributing to this unofficial ToyyibPay Python SDK repository
* Participating in project discussions on GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussions
* Engaging in project-related communication channels

**Note**: This is a community-driven project created by an independent developer. Any representation should make it clear that this is an unofficial SDK and not affiliated with ToyyibPay Sdn. Bhd.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community maintainer at **mwaizwafiq@gmail.com**. As this is a community-driven project maintained by an individual developer, response times may vary, but all complaints will be reviewed and investigated as promptly as possible.

All community members who help with moderation are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

The community maintainer will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action deemed in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from the maintainer, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project community.

## Security Considerations

Given that this project deals with payment processing:

* **Never** share real API keys, merchant credentials, or production secrets in issues, pull requests, or any public forum
* **Always** use test/sandbox credentials in examples and documentation
* Report security vulnerabilities privately to the maintainer at mwaizwafiq@gmail.com
* Do not create public issues for security vulnerabilities
* Follow responsible disclosure practices
* Remember this is an **unofficial** SDK - always verify security practices with ToyyibPay's official documentation
